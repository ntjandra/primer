Docs for Primer
###############

Hosted Pages
============

Primer: https://primer.readthedocs.io/
Project: https://readthedocs.org/projects/primer/

Local Run
=========

Run the project locally to see how it will look. 

Note: If you're using a theme, you will need to import it or comment out ``html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'`` from the ``conf.py`` file.

Build the project using the ``make.bat`` in ``/docs/`` with ``./make.bat html``

Once the site is built, go to the homepage at ``build/html/index.html``
