Docs for Primer
=======================================

Hosted Pages:

Primer: https://primer.readthedocs.io/
Project: https://readthedocs.org/projects/primer/

Local Run
=========

Run the project locally to see how it will look. 

Note: If you're using a theme, you will need to import it or comment out `html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'` from the `conf.py`` file.

Build the project using the `make.bat` in `/docs/` with `./make.bat html`

Once the site is built, go to the homepage at `build/html/index.html`
