ActiveRPG System
################

ActiveR is a roleplaying system focused on making more active decisions between the storyteller and players.

Dice Rules
##########

ActiveR has four dice types: story, combat, luck, and loot. The d4 is used for the majority of play and is called the story dice. For encounters, combat dices are used including the d6,d8, d10, and d12. Next, the d20 is reserved for lucky or unlucky moments, such as something completely backfiring or just plain gambling. Finally, the d100 is used for a loot table as determined by the storyteller.

Story Dice
==========

A story dice is represented by a d4 with 4 values, ranging from 1 to 4. These numbers represent absolute failure, failure, success, and absolute success. Based on player performance a GM may choose to assign modifiers to the story dice at will.

Story Check
-----------

For instance, during a speech a player roleplays well, a storyteller may add a +1 modifier so the worst possible outcome is a 2, likewise 2, 3 and 4 both count as an success, ensuring the player cannot have an absolute failure, while increasing the chances of a positive outcome. 

Similarly, the inverse is true, where if a player roleplays terribly they cannot have an absolute success. This ensures the story matches the player's performance and gives the storyteller an active role.

Combat Dice
==============
Combat dice are used to roll for damage a target takes. Damage dice is based entirely on weapon type and range.

Lucky Dice
==============

The lucky dice are used during situations where it would be unfair for the storyteller or player to decide on their own. It is reserved as the true rng dice for story altering or improvised moments.

Improvised Check
----------------

A player decides to throw an improvised weapon, to decide the range of how far they throw, they roll the Lucky Dice. It results in a 15, so the object is thrown 15 ft depending on the storytellers ratio. After that, the player rolls the weapon's damage die to see how much it deals.

Loot Dice
=========

The loot dice are a form of luck die, is used for determining loot such as money drops, items, and "variable" things that are not constant. Once again, depending on performance the storyteller may add modifiers to this dice as well.

Loot Roll
---------

The party defeats a simple encounter. The storyteller rolls a d100 and gets a 100. Because the encounter is simple, even though it's a 100, the storyteller gives 25 gold which was the upper limit.
